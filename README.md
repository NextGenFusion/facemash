# FaceMesh Display with React and MediaPipe

This project is a React application that utilizes [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev) to display a 3D Face Mesh. It leverages the power of computer vision to map facial landmarks in real-time, offering a foundation for projects like augmented reality, facial recognition, or animation.

## Features

- **Real-time Face Mesh Mapping**: Maps and displays facial landmarks using MediaPipe.
- **React Integration**: Fully built using React to allow easy component reuse and state management.
